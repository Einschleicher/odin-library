# odin-library
Let’s extend the ‘Book’ example from the Objects and Object Constructors lesson and turn it into a small Library app.

#### Self-reflection
*Took a lot of effort, my JavaScript skills from the fundamentals series are already a bit rusty. But practice makes perfect. Gonna do further styling on a later code review. I didn't get the context of `event.preventDefault()`, as I don't need any `GET/POST` method for this to work. I also pretty much bloated my `displayLibrary()` function, will split the code in a later review. On to the next JavaScript project. TEsssssST*
